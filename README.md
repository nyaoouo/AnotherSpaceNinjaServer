## Project Status

This project is in active development at <https://onlyg.it/OpenWF/SpaceNinjaServer>.

To get an idea of what functionality you can expect to be missing [have a look through the issues](https://onlyg.it/OpenWF/SpaceNinjaServer/issues?q=&type=all&state=open&labels=-4%2C-10&milestone=0&assignee=0&poster=). However, many things have been implemented and *should* work as expected. Please open an issue for anything where that's not the case and/or the server is reporting errors.

## config.json

SpaceNinjaServer requires a `config.json`. To set it up, you can copy the [config-vanilla.json](config-vanilla.json), which has most cheats disabled.

- `logger.level` can be `fatal`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `http`, `debug`, or `trace`.
- `myIrcAddresses` can be used to point to an IRC server. If not provided, defaults to `[ myAddress ]`.
- `worldState.eidolonOverride` can be set to `day` or `night` to lock the time to day/fass and night/vome on Plains of Eidolon/Cambion Drift.
- `worldState.vallisOverride` can be set to `warm` or `cold` to lock the temperature on Orb Vallis.
- `worldState.duviriOverride` can be set to `joy`, `anger`, `envy`, `sorrow`, or `fear` to lock the Duviri spiral.
- `worldState.nightwaveOverride` will lock the nightwave season, assuming the client is new enough for it. Valid values:
